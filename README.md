# CR2LF Burp Suite Extension

A simple extension that creates a new Raw Editor tab in Request and Response editors called `CR2LF` that converts lines ending in `\r\n` with just `\n`.

This is to fix blank line creations when copy/pasting between Linux and Windows systems: particularly into applications like Microsoft Word.
